i could tell you. but then i'd have to kill you
that's for me to know. and for you to find out
that's a secret
I'm not allowed to say
that's personal
that's top secret
if i tell you. then everyone would know
i'd tell you if you could keep it to yourself
who wants to know?
why so nosey?
quit being so nosey?
i can't tell you. it's embarassing
